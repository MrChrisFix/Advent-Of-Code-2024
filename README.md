# Advent-Of-Code-Template
A template repository for my Advent of Code repositories.
It inludes:
- A Visual Studio solution for C++
- A class for determing what day should be executed
- 25 cpp files for every day of the advent with pre-written functions
- A single general header file for all the 25 cpp files
- 2 text files for test- and real puzzle input per day (50 txt files)
